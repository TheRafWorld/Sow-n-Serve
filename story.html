            <p class="inside">From our humble beginnings, we have come a long way. Starting off as a plant-themed cafe, we had a dedication to the environment. We began by donating used coffee grounds and leftover food to local farms to be used as compost. We soon realized, however, that we were not doing enough. All around us, small businesses and farms were forced to close due to large corporations coming in and taking their business. We knew that this was an issue worth fighting for. We moved out of our small cafe in downtown Dover and purchased a rural plot of land to build our restaurant. After construction was completed, we knew we had to take this all the way. We purchased ingredients exclusively from local producers and poured time and dedication into our menu to make it as sustainable as possible. Early investments like solar on the roof and a well for water cut down costs and make our establishment economically viable. We were also supported by local environmental groups that hoped more restaurants like us would begin popping up. And eventually, more did. Local farms began to flourish with money coming in from individual customers and businesses like us. Now, we take extreme pride in our role in the community and will continue helping others contribute as well.</p>
