            <p class="inside">At Sow N’ Serve, our goal is to serve our customers the freshest food possible. 90% of the food is house-made from herbs from our garden or fruit and vegetables from local Delaware farms. Supporting these farmers not only helps build our community, but it also serves to better the nutrition and health of our customers. 15% of our profit goes back to these farmers in order to support their needs. We believe that being able to help our farmers fosters a community of caring and interconnectedness.</p>

          <h1>How we Support Small Business</h1>
          <div class="ourStoryImgNTxt">
            <p class="inside">Our goal as a business is to play an active role in supporting Delaware’s local economy in the hopes of preserving family farms. Local farms tend to be more extensive because their food is produced on a smaller scale, but this does not deter us. Our dedication to these farms and monetary support have allowed several to make significant expansions. In the end this benefits us, the business, consumers, and the farms by strengthening the connections in our small state. We strongly believe that it is our responsibility as members of our community to support these businesses in every way we can. This dedication goes beyond purchasing produce. That is why, new this year, we have expanded our restaurant to include a store with local Delaware products for sale. 90% of profits go directly back to the business, and customers may discover new small businesses and services from our wall of business cards.</p>

            <p class="inside">Our approach to waste reduction is twofold. Our menu changes with the seasons. In the summer our menu is diverse, filled with fresh fruits and vegetables that are purchased from local family farms in Sussex County. This is also the time we grow garlic, onions, and spices to preserve for the rest of the year. In the colder months, we rely on pickled foods, preserved foods, and winter crops for our meals. We have found that this style of cultivating our menu allows customers to be more connected with the seasons around them. Less food is wasted due to expiration, and fewer pollutants are released into the environment from trying to grow food outside of its natural growing season. We also take a more typical approach to waste reduction. First, we use as much of each fruit and vegetable as possible. From using peach stems and pits as garnish to frying cucumber peels for a tasty side, the only limit is our imagination. Any remaining organic waste produced by our kitchen or leftover food is donated to local farms to be used as animal feed or compost. We find that this approach to sustainability benefits not only the environment but also the local businesses that use our donations.</p>
